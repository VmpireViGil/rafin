Beside the tech life I love sketching, watching movies and singing. I also like travelling as it refreshes the entire mind with new concepts and saves us from burning out.

I have plans to move abroad after 12th, do a job until I save a good amount of money to start a tech business. And then keep inventing as much as we can to make the future life easier and reliable.
